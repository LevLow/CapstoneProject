# Random Forest Regression to Predict Cancer Rates Base on Data from the OECD
## Introduciton
### My name is Levi. This is the capstone project for my Masters in Data Anlytics.
### In this project I will explore data gathered from The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to build a machine learning model that can predict cancer rates based on Country, Year, and type of cancer. 
### Data was dowloaded from https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?fs[0]=Topic%2C0%7CHealth%23HEA%23&pg=0&fc=Topic&bp=true&snb=36&df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_HEALTH_STAT%40DF_C&df[ag]=OECD.ELS.HD&df[vs]=1.0&pd=2000%2C&dq=.A...........&ly[rw]=REF_AREA&ly[cl]=TIME_PERIOD&ly[rs]=SEX%2CCANCER_SITE&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false

## Steps in Process
### Collect Data
### Explore and Clean Data
### Develop and Test Model
### Visulize Model
### Analyze Data
###
## Requirements for this Project
### Github to fork repo
### Jupyter Lab
### Python (3.12.1)
### VSCode (not necessary, but it is what I used to organize and code) 
###
## Project Libraries
### Pandas
### Numpy
### Matplotlib
### Seaborn
### SciKit-Learn
###
## Project Files
### Capstone Cleaning and EDA.ipynb: Jupyter notebook Cleaning and exploration of the dataset
### Capstone Models.ipynb: Notebook with the models and visulizations
### OECDHEALTHDATA.csv: Original Data file downloaded from the OECD website
### OECD_Final.csv: CSV generated after first round of cleaning
### OECD_MN.csv: CSV generated after second round of cleaning. Contains only cancer rates for "Malignant neoplasms" cancer site
### OECD_NOMN.csv: CSV generated after second round of cleaning. Does not contain cancer rates for "Malignant neoplasms" cancer site.
